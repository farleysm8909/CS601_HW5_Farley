Week 5

How Sam Farley went above and beyond
- Added one of my personal images and image caption in addition to table when button is clicked
- Spent considerable time styling the table with CSS, for example:
    - color theme
    - drop shadow
    - alternating colors for different rows
    - columns have equal widths
    - sans-serif font
- Used one of my images as the background image (faded using an external image editor)
- Used a recursive function in script.js to populate table with JSON data
- Commented code in script.js to improve readability/explain the logic in case it isn't clear on its own
- Used let and template literals in script.js
